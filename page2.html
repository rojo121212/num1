            <p> hi :)
                <br></br>
                if i remember correctly, we started dating
                about a month ago today. 
                since i can't be with you in person
                and a letter wouldn't get to 
                you in time, i thought this would be a good way
                to tell you how much you mean to me.
                <br></br>
                these past couple months
                have been full of you. whether 
                we're calling, texting, hanging out, or 
                none of the above, you are always on my mind.
                you make all my days better and with just your
                presence you somewhow manage to make every 
                worry i hold disappear. 
                you remind me of every love song i hear and 
                talking to you makes me feel like i'm living out
                every lovey laufey tune i listen to. 
                you are truly one of a kind and i pinch myself everyday
                every time i'm reminded i get to be your girlfriend.
                <br></br>
                with that being said, happy one month
                olivia ritter <33
