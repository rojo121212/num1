            <p> hey there 
                <br></br>
                 if i remember correctly, we started dating
                about a month ago today. 
                since i can't be with you in person
                and a letter wouldn't get to 
                you in time, i thought this would be a good way
                to tell you how much you mean to me.
                <br></br>
                 these past couple months
                have been full of you. whether 
                we're calling, texting, hanging out, or 
                none of the above, you are always on my mind.
                you make my days better and with just your
                presence you somewhow manage to make every 
                worry i hold disappear. 
                you are truly an amazing person and i am
                so lucky to have you as my girlfriend.
                <br></br>
                with that being said, happy one month
